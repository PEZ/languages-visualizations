# Languages Visualizations

(With optional Start Times)

![alt text](public/images/langauges-visualizations-header.png)

This a playground for visualizing the the [Languages](https://github.com/bddicken/languages) benchmark of [Benjamin Dicken](https://github.com/bddicken)'s.

* The visualizations are here: [pez.github.io/languages-visualizations/](https://pez.github.io/languages-visualizations/) (There are some more notes about the experiment there.)
* The benchmarks project is [Benjamin Dicken](https://github.com/bddicken)'s **Languages**, here: [github.com/bddicken/languages](https://github.com/bddicken/languages).

## You favorite language is missing?

> If you lack some language in the visualizations, let me know in an issue. If you include instructions on how to get the toolchain installed on a Mac silicon (without any Docker involved) it increases the chances I get the language included.

## How this was built

The visualizations app is written with [Replicant](https://github.com/cjohansen/replicant) (the page with ‚Äúnavigation‚Äù) and [Quil](https://github.com/quil/quil) (the animated visualizations). There's a sprinkle of [Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) for collecting the JSON files written by the [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) benchmark runner. Some of the icons come from [techicons.dev](https://techicons.dev/).

I hope you fork this project and have some fun with it. üòÑ
